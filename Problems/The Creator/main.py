The Creator
Suppose, you're creating a fantasy role-playing game and want to have a class for elves. 
Elves are quite tall creatures, their average height is 1.8 meters, their weapon of choice is 
longbow and they reach emotional_maturity at the age of 125. Create the class Elf with the 
attributes height, weapon, and emotional_maturity. Note that height and emotional_maturity should 
have numerical value.

You only need to create the class, no need to print anything!

Caution
You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. 
Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
