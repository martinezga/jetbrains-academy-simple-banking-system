Point
Create a class Point that will represent a point in space. 
Its constructor needs two parameters \(x\) and \(y\), the coordinates of a point on the plane. 
The class should have a method dist that takes another instance of Point and returns the Euclidean 
distance between these two points. For Point(x1, y1) and Point(x2, y2), calculate the distance 
according to the formula:

\[d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}\]Have a look at the following example:

p1 = Point(1.5, 1)
p2 = Point(1.5, 2)

print(p1.dist(p2))  # 1.0
Just create the class, you won't need anything else.

Caution
You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. 
Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
