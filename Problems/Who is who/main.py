Who is who
Below are two classes: Angel and Demon.

They have certain characteristics that help tell them apart. 
These characteristics are listed as attributes.

Create instances of these classes and print their attributes, first Angel, then Demon. 
You should print the attributes in this order: color, feature, home. Each should be on a separate line.
